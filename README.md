# Kernel basics repository

This is a document and set of Julia codes demonstrating the basic (and some
not-so-basic) computations that go into Gaussian process regression and
Bayesian optimization in the not-too-big n case.  The documentation is
generated by running the [`ldoc`](src/ldoc.lua) processor on annotated Julia
files with special comments in order to get a Quarto notebook, which is then
rendered as a PDF.

See the [rendered PDF](quarto/_output/basics.pdf)!
